# Advent-of-Code-2022

My personal python solutions for the different challenges of Advent of Code 2022. I try these challenges just for fun as  a study break, I do not claim in any way that these are the most efficient or elegant solutions :)

For every day, the puzzle input can be found in a seperate text file. Both parts of every challenge are solved in the same .py file.
